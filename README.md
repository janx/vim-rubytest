Rubytest.vim
============

Rubytest.vim is a vim (http://www.vim.org) plugin, which helps you to run ruby test (including vanilla test, rspec, shoulda etc.) in vim.

Installation
------------

Copy all files to your ~/.vim directory.

Usage
-----

After installation, press `<Leader>t` will run the test under your cursor if you are editing a ruby test file.

Example:

```
$ cd <your rails/merb root>
$ vim test/unit/user_test.rb
```
(move cursor into a test case, press `<Leader>t`)

(`<Leader>` is mapping to '\' by default in vim)

Be default, the plugin will print output in terminal. You can change this behavior by putting this line in your vimrc file:

    let g:rubytest_output = <output>

The following `<output>` values are supported:

* `quickfix` - show failed tests in a quickfix window
* `vim_terminal` - run the tests in a vim terminal (vim version 8.1 or higher)

With this set, test errors will be displayed in quickfix window, and you can jump to the error location quickly by select the error message and hit return (or `Ctrl-w return` to open it in new window).

You can customize the command which will be used to run the test case by setting these options in your vimrc file:

    let g:rubytest_cmd_test = "ruby %p"
    let g:rubytest_cmd_testcase = "ruby %p -n '/%c/'"
    let g:rubytest_cmd_spec = "spec -f specdoc %p"
    let g:rubytest_cmd_example = "spec -f specdoc %p -e '%c'"
    let g:rubytest_cmd_feature = "cucumber %p"
    let g:rubytest_cmd_story = "cucumber %p -n '%c'"

### Using [Spork](https://github.com/sporkrb/spork)

    let g:rubytest_cmd_test = "bundle exec testdrb %p"
    let g:rubytest_cmd_testcase = "bundle exec testdrb %p -- -n '/%c/'"

### Using [Spring](https://github.com/rails/spring)

    let g:rubytest_cmd_test = "bundle exec spring testunit %p"
    let g:rubytest_cmd_testcase = "bundle exec spring testunit %p -n '/%c/'"

### Using [Zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus)

Note that Zeus is not typically run from within the project's bundle context, so `bundle exec` is omitted from example

    let g:rubytest_cmd_test = "zeus test %p"
    let g:rubytest_cmd_testcase = "zeus test %p -n '/%c/'"

Placeholders:

* `%p`: path of test file
* `%c`: test case name
* `%s`: only for minitest, replaced by closest suite name (class whose name begin with 'Test'). This can be used to match test case more exactly:

    let g:rubytest_cmd_testcase = "ruby %p -n '%s#%c'"

Default Key Bindings
--------------------

* `<Leader>t`: run test case under cursor
* `<Leader>T`: run all tests in file
* `<Leader>l`: run the last test, from any buffer

You can change default key bindings:

    map <Leader>\ <Plug>RubyTestRun     " change from <Leader>t to <Leader>\
    map <Leader>] <Plug>RubyFileRun     " change from <Leader>T to <Leader>]
    map <Leader>/ <Plug>RubyTestRunLast " change from <Leader>l to <Leader>/

Tip
---

* Rubytest.vim works perfectly with vim-localvimrc, which enables you to set different test run command for different projects. Check details at: https://github.com/embear/vim-localvimrc
